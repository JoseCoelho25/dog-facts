# React Dog Facts API - React+Vite & Tailwind - 

This is a project i took the idea during my React classes and decided to do it on react!

The project consists of a responsive site using react, and tailwind for the design with the following:

- Render an initial list of items to the page (from dog API);
- Implement controls to remove existing items;
- Implement controls to remove all the selected items at the same time;
- Implement a means to set one of the items as ‘selected’;
- Implement controls to add new item based on API;
